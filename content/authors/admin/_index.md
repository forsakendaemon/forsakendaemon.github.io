Dr David Allen is a Senior Research Audiologist at the National Acoustic Laboratories. His current active research interests include: the use of connected health in hearing rehabilitation; the development of outcome measures appropriate for hearing rehabilitation services in the community; the determination of appropriate methods for the targeting of hearing rehabilitation to those most likely to benefit; the use of machine learning in hearing services delivery; methods of characterising hearing loss and difficulty beyond the audiogram; and the audiological care of emerging adults with hearing loss.

Before joining NAL in 2019, he taught Audiology and mixed research methods as a casual academic at the University of Queensland while completing his PhD through the HEARing CRC, studying the nature of Patient- and Family-Centred Care in the hearing habilitation of emerging adults with hearing loss.

He also holds an Honorary Research Fellow position at Macquarie University.
