summary: "This talk will present an overview of a recent Department of Health-funded project exploring the establishment of standardised outcome domains for the assessment of hearing rehabilitation. It will be presented by Melanie Ferguson."
abstract: "A variety of outcome measures are currently used for the assessment of hearing rehabilitation services in Australia. However, there is to date no consensus about which of these outcome measures should be used. The principles of experience-based co-design suggest that health services, policymakers, and researchers should come together with patients and their families to design health services and define what metrics should be used for their success.\n\n#### Objectives\nTo that end, this study aimed to obtain a consensus view of what constitutes successful hearing rehabilitation according to end-users of hearing rehabilitation services (patients and families).\n\n#### Methods\nA sample of hearing services consumers identified as representatives by not-for-profit consumer organisations developed a series of statements that were then disseminated to a national sample of hearing services consumers (including both patients and family members) as part of an online Delphi process. This process continued until consensus was reached.\n\n#### Results\nThis study is ongoing. Results to be presented will include the consensus view that was reached on the essential elements of successful hearing rehabilitation.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThese results may be used by clinicians and hearing services to inform the development of clinically appropriate and patient-centred metrics for successful hearing rehabilitation."
