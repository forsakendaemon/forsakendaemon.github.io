title: "The nature of patient- and family-centred care according to Australian young adults living with hearing loss and their family members"
event: "Audiology Australia National Conference 2018"
location: "Sydney, Australia"
summary: "The aim of this study was to investigate and define PFCC as defined by 16–25 year old Australians living with hearing loss and their family members, using a grounded theoretic methodology. This talk presented a model of patient- and family-centred care developed through in-depth qualitative interviews with young people with hearing loss."
abstract: "The incorporation of patient perspectives into the structure and nature of health care is vital for the delivery of appropriate, patient- and family-centred care (PFCC). Hearing loss presents a particular challenge for young adults (16–25 years old) as they navigate the transition from secondary schooling to tertiary study, traineeships, and the workforce. To date, no research has focused on the nature of PFCC as defined by young adults living with hearing loss and their family members.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate and define PFCC as defined by 16–25 year old Australians living with hearing loss and their family members, using a grounded theoretic methodology.\n\n#### Methods\nQualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with approximately 20 Australian young adults living with hearing loss and their family members. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a constructivist grounded theoretic approach to generate an understanding of PFCC in this population.\n\n#### Results\nThe results of this analysis will be presented, particularly as they relate to the perspectives of young adults living with hearing loss and their family members on nature of patient- and family-centred hearing rehabilitation.\n\n#### Conclusions\nBy better tailoring hearing care, particularly towards aspects of rehabilitation that young people and their families experience as important, clinicians can ensure that their efforts are experienced as effective by their patients and their families. These results will be of interest to clinicians and clinic managers who see young adult patients with hearing loss, especially under the NDIS."
